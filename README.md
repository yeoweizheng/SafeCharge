# SafeCharge
[Requires TP-Link HS100 WiFi Smart Plug to work]<br><br>
Coupled with the WiFi smart plug, this app allows the user to set a custom battery level threshold (eg. 80% full), above which the smart plug will be turned off to stop the charging process.<br><br>
Useful in cases when the user wishes to leave the phone charging overnight, but not until 100% to avoid premature battery degradation.

### Usage
1. Using the TP-Link Kasa Smart app, connect the smart plug to an existing WiFi network.
2. Connect the android device to the same WiFi network.
3. Connect phone charging adapter & cable to the smart plug.
4. Launch the app, scan & select the smart plug
5. Test the remote on / off functions
6. Enter the desired charging threshold
7. Start service to enable auto-cut off when battery level is reached
